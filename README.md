The following scenario of a recently hired Junior Data Analyst in a local government office, who has been tasked with importing some data from another department which relates to inventory information about their fleet of vehicles. Images are used to visulize progress. 

## Step 1 Data Cleaning
The data is in comma-separated value (CSV) format and the data also needs cleaning up before you can start to run any kind of analysis on it.

 ## Step 2 Anaylsis and Pivot Tables
 We will take our data after it was cleaned and prepared and create some pivot tables from it to help you analyze the data
 
Use AutoSum to calculate values: Use AutoSum to find the following values for column ‘C’ and record each of the values:
 
-SUM
-AVERAGE
-MIN
-MAX
-COUNT
